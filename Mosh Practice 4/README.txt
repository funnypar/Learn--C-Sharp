## Practice Questions

### 1. Consecutive Numbers
Write a program that asks the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen (`-`). Determine if the numbers are consecutive.  
Example inputs and outputs:  
- Input: `5-6-7-8-9` → Output: `Consecutive`  
- Input: `20-19-18-17-16` → Output: `Consecutive`  
- Input: `5-6-8-9` → Output: `Not Consecutive`

### 2. Duplicate Numbers
Write a program that asks the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen (`-`). If the user presses Enter without providing input, exit the program. Otherwise, check for duplicates in the input.  
Output: `Duplicate` if there are duplicates.

### 3. Valid Time
Write a program that asks the user to enter a time value in 24-hour format (e.g., `19:00`).  
- A valid time should be between `00:00` and `23:59`.  
- If the time is valid, display `Ok`; otherwise, display `Invalid Time`.  
- If the user provides no input, consider it invalid.

### 4. PascalCase Converter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a few words separated by spaces. Use the input to create a variable name in **PascalCase**.  
Example:  
- Input: `number of students` → Output: `NumberOfStudents`  
- Input: `NUMBER OF STUDENTS` → Output: `NumberOfStudents`
